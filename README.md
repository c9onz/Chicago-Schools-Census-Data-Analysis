# Chicago-Schools-Census-Data-Analysis
This repo analyzes Chicago Public Schools and Census data (2011-2012) from IBM Labs to understand level performance, college enrollments, population segments, poverty, and income distributions by community area. Used SQL and Python in Jupyter notebook for pre-processing, charting, and data analysis.<br><br> The original IBM Lab was much shorter and primarily designed to demonstrate technical and analytical skills in SQL. I expanded on this analysis while I was reviewing the datasets and the initial lab questions to get a better understanding of the aforementioned attributes.<br><br>
