# Chicago-Schools-Census-Data-Analysis
This repo analyzes Chicago Public Schools and Census data (2011-2012) from IBM Labs to understand level performance, college enrollments, population segments, poverty, and income distributions by community area. It's an expansion from the original IBM Lab, which was much shorter and primarily designed to demonstrate technical and analytical skills in SQL.<br><br> For this analysis, I used SQL and Python in Jupyter notebook for pre-processing, visualizations, and data analysis and decided to expand on it while I was reviewing the datasets and the initial lab questions (which had many gaps and was difficult to follow) to get a better understanding of the aforementioned attributes.<br><br>
